With a network operational time of 10 hours, a network size of 19 Z1 nodes (excluding the sink), and a message interval of 120 seconds.
The attacks commence after 6 minutes, with the malicious nodes alternating every 6 minutes between executing 
one of the three described attacks and behaving as legitimate nodes. The benign traffic is in the time given by the following formula:
t = (2 + 12*n + 2*k) * 60                                                          
For VNA attack:
t = (8 + 36*n + 2*k) * 60                                                         
For Rank attack:
t = (20 + 36*n + 2*k) * 60                                                       
For DIS attack:
t = (32 + 36*n + 2*k) * 60                                                       
With :
n = 0:N-1, it is based on how many 36-min intervals 
k = 0:2 it presents the 2 minutes interval ID in the 6 minutes period.	

Attacking nodes:
Node 7 VN Attack, 
Node 9 Rank Attack, 
Node 6 DIS attack
